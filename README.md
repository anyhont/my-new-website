# my-new-website
This website was created for my New Musical Interface Design class
I was able to do most of the work but adding audio to the webpage was a bit tough!
Regardless I want to thank my teacher Visda Goudarzi for teaching such an interesting course
I wouldn't have been able to do any of this without her guidance.
